Check Digit
---
- Mathematically calculated value added to data to ensure that the original data has not been altered

Good to know:
---

(1)When objective is to identify transcription and transposition error, answer should be check digit.

(2)When objective is to ensure accuracy, answer should be check digit.

(3)When objective is to identify transmission error, answer should be parity bits or checksum (higher version of parity bit) or CRC (higher version of checksum).

(4)When objective is to ensure completeness, answer should be parity bits or checksum (higher version of parity bit) or CRC (higher version of checksum).

(5)When objective is to ensure integrity, answer should be parity bits or checksum (higher version of parity bit) or CRC (higher version of checksum).

(6)For point no. (3), (4) and (5), first preferences to be given as follow:

(i)First preference to CRC  
(ii)If CRC is not there as option then preference to be given to Checksum  
(iii)If CRC and Checksum both are not there in option then preference to be given to Parity Bits.

(7)When objective is to correct (detect & correct) transmission error, answer should be Forward Error Control (FEC).

(8)When objective is to ensure that a transaction must either fully happen, or not happens at all, answer should be atomicity.
