 2.1 Performing an IS Audit
 - Must be independent of the audit work and have no real or perceived conflicts of interest
 - Independence can be compromised by:
	 - Auditing own work
	 - Decision making authority
	 - Ties to the client or department

**Types of IS Audits
1. Compliance audit - adherence to legal, regulatory or contractual obligations
2. Operational - evaluate internal controls for a given info system
3. Security & Privacy - Achieve appropriate levels of the CIA traid and privacy
4. Forensic - discover disclose and follow-up on fraud and crimes
5. External Standard - Audit based on an external standard performed by a 3rd party
**Audit Workflow
1. Identify Audit Target (subset of the audit universe)
2. Define the Audit Plan (Scope and Objective)
3. Identify auditor skills, resources, sources of information, communications path
4. Determine audit procedures including data collection and testing
5. Collect and evaluate evidence
6. Analyze evidence and prepare report
7. Discuss report w/management
	- Gain agreement whenever necessary
8. Present Audit report to the Audit Committee or equivalent
9. Follow-up activities (Optional)

Audit Considerations
- *Materiality* is the importance of an item of info with regard to its impact or effect on the functioning of the entity being audited 
	- Expression of relative significance
- *Detection Risk* is risk that material errors or misstatatements will not be detected by auditor
	- Weaker the audit procedures; higher detection risk
- *Audit risk* - is the risk of reaching a incorrect conclusion
_________________________________

2.2 Gathering Audit Evidence - all information, obtained fom audit procedures or other sources, used to arrive at the conclusions 
	- The amount of evidence collected is directly related to the purpose, objective and scope of the audit
	- Other "amount" criteria include level of risk and quality of evidence
Evidence Collection Obj
	Compliance testing validates confomrane with control procedures (attribute)
		ex: compliance with conducting background checks
	*Substantive testing* validates the integrity of a transactional function (value) by comparing data from one source with evidence from another source
		ex: inventory report and physical count
_____________________
Evidence Collection Techniques
1. Inspection - Review of documentation and records
2. Observation - Looking at or watching a process (potential audit influence)
3. Inquiry - Interview/Question personnel (Potential audit influence)
4. Confirmation
5. Direct the arithmetic accuracy of calculations
6. Reforming procedures
7. Comparison of data sets to identify trends, relationships, and/or performance over time.
8. Source Code Comparison - Automated comparison to two or more versions of the same program
9. Integrated Test Facility (ITF) - Fictitious transactions processes alongside live input
___________

Ruless of Evidence
-To be considered, evidence must be competent and sufficient.
	A. Competency - refers to the quality, relevancy, and reliability of the evidence
	B. Sufficiency - the measure of the quantity of audit evidence
________

Reliability Factors
- Factors for considering the reliability of evidence include:
	- Independence of the provider
	- Qualifications of provider
	- Objectivity of evidence
	- Timing of evidence
	- Internal controls over evidence
_______________

**Order of Evidence Reliability**
	^ System Generated
		^ Auditor Generated
			^ Third Party provided
					^ Auditee Provided

All findings must be supported by evidence
	- If the evidence is inconclusive, questionable, or contested, the auditor must expand the scope to include further investigation and/or root cause analysis
	- must be able to justify findings


**2.3 Understanding Sampling Techniques**
	Evidence Sampling -
		- Sampling is used to infer characteristics about a population based upon the characteristics of a sample
		- Evidence Sampling is applying a procedure to less than 100% of the population
	Audit Sampling
		- Provides factual evidence and a reasonable basis to draw conclusions about a population from which a sample is selected
			- Sampling risk is risk that the auditor's conclusion based on a sample might be different if they examined the entire population.

Audit Sampling Approaches
	- statistical sampling is an objective method for determining a sample size and selection criteria.
		- Each items should have a equal probablility of selection
	- Non-statistical sampling is a subjective method for determining which items are the most material, relevant and/or risky
		- Included items are based on professional judgement
	- Block sampling consists of all items in a selected time period, numerical sequence or alphabetical sequence

Sampling Methods
	Attribute Sampling - an item being sampled either will or wont possess certain qualities or features
		An auditor selects a certain number of records to estimate how many times a certain attribute will show up in a population (proportional)
	Variable Sampling (Dollar estimation) - used to estimate the monetary value or other unit of measure
	
Attribute Sampling Mechanics

Fixed Sample plan - % of occurrence in a defined population (how many)
Stop and go sampling - Sampling method that allows the auditor to stop the audit once a reasonable conclusion can be drawn or hypothesis supported
	-Useful when required confidence level is very low
Discovery Sampling/Exploratory Sampling - Used when evidence of a single error or instance would be material (Ex. Fraud or illegal activity)
	- Evidence must be handled in accordance with forensic and legal requirements

Variable Sampling Mechanics

	Stratified mean per unit - Population is divided onto strata and samples drawn from various strata which is used to calculate means.
	Unstratified mean per unit - Calculation of a sample mean and projected as an estimated total

Sampling Rules of Thumb
	Based on professional judgement
		- low risk generally requires a small sample
		- High risk generally requires large sample or complete check
		- Strong controls generally require a small sample
		- Weak controls generally require an expanded sample size

Audit Sampling Process Flow
	- Determine the test objective

2.4 Communicating Audit Results
	Pre Meeting - discuss goals and objectives
		provide sense of whats going on
		Allow questions
	Communication During
		- Interacting with personnel associated with audit
		- Keep managment informed
		- **If immediate threat is identified -- Report Immediately**
	Audit Fixes
	-if a finding is responded too, the finding must be documnented
	Exit Interview
		-Communicate audit results to managment and obtain comments on proposed findings and recommendations
			Management input is important because it can clarify an auditor's understandings of facts
	Draft Audit Review
		discuss findings with management of the audit target
			Gain agreement
			Create action plan
	Disagreements
		- If management disagrees, auditor must provided detailed explanation
			- if still disaagree, include response in final report
	- Audit Reports
		- Intro - synopsis of objective, scope period process procedures
		- Audit Findings
		- Conclusion | Opinion - auditor opinion as to the adequacy of controls and associated risk
		- Reservations | Qualifications - Options include unqualified, qualified, adverse
		- Detailed findings and recommendations - level of detail may depend upon the materiality of the findings and intended audience
		- Memorandum - minor issues in seperate memo
		- Work Papers - audit support documentation (Not part of report)
	-Audit Conclusions - auditing  standards require that sufficient, relevant, and reliable evidence is obtained to support audit conclusions and opinions
		-exam report can also include a disclaimer that the auditor was not able to render an opinion due to named circumstances 
	Auditor Opinions
		Unqualified Opinion - no significant reservations is rendered by auditor
		Qualified Opinion - rendered when there are minor deviations or scope limitations
		Adverse Opinion - rendered when target is not in conformance with the control objectives or when the evidence is misleading or misstated.
	Audit Report Executive Briefing
		Audit report is delivered to highest level management as stated by audit charter
			- If management requests the auditor's assistance, the auditor has a duty to consider the impact the auditor's independence
		Auditor Report Follow-up
			- Auditor should have follow-up program to determine management has taken corrective action
				- Timing and level of involvmenent depend on materiality
____________

2.5 Audit Evolutions
	Traditional - begins with formulating audit plan, transitioning into the collection and analysis of audit evidence, formulating opinions and presentating the report to executive management
	Evolving Audit - Optimized to capture information in real-time with extensive employee input, employee multi-levels of analysis and benefit from near-time improvement
		1. Control Self-Assesment (CSA) - assessment of controls made by staff and management
			- Process is meant to shift control monitoring responsibilities and leverage audit resources
				- Increased organizational awareness of risk and controls
				- Early detection of problems.
			- CSA methodologies range from surveys and questionaires to formal audit-facilitated workshops
			- Ultimate goal is employee empowerment
			- Everyone pitch in model
		- Process
			- Define CSA Scope principles and objectives
				- Define roles and responsibilities
					- Schedule CSA training and Roll-out
						- Establish CSA requirements by functional process
							- Perform CSA testing and review
								- Remediate identified control deficiencies
									- Review lessons learned and refined CSA program
		2. Integrated Auditing - collaborative process that considers info technology, financial and operational controls as mutually dependent for establishing an effective and efficient internal control environment
			1. Breaks down audit silos and redundancy
		3. Continuous Auditing - test transactions close to the time at which they occur, to ensure they are in compliance with the controls that should be in place and to identify an transactions that appear to be in error or fraudulent
			-Shift from sample-based audititing to 100% coverage
			-Leverages constrained audit resources
