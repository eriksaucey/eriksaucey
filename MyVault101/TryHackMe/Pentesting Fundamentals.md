Hat Category
	White Hat - 
		Considered Good People
		Remain within the law and use their skills to benefit others
	Grey Hat - 
		Use their skills to benefit others often, do not follow the law or ethical standards at all times. 
			Ex: Someone taking down a scamming site
	Black Hat - 
		Criminals often seeking to damage orgs or gain financial benefit
			Ex: Ransomware authors infect devices with malicious code and hold data for ransom

Rules of Engagement (RoE)
	1. Permission
		This section of the document gives explicit permission for the engagement to be carried out. This permission is essential to legally protect individuals and organisations for the activities they carry out.
	2. Test Scope
		This section of the document will annotate specific targets to which the engagement should apply. For example, the penetration test may only apply to certain servers or applications but not the entire network.
	3. Rules
		The rules section will define exactly the techniques that are permitted during the engagement. For example, the rules may specifically state that techniques such as phishing attacks are prohibited, but MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks are okay.

Penetration Methodology
	Stages
		1. Info Gathering
			This stage involves collecting as much publically accessible information about a target/organisation as possible, for example, OSINT and research.
				**Note:** This does not involve scanning any systems.
		2. Enumeration Scanning
			This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially vulnerable.
		3. Exploitation
				This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or exploiting application logic.
		4. Privilege Escalation
			Once you have successfully exploited a system or application (known as a foothold), this stage is the attempt to expand your access to a system. You can escalate horizontally and vertically, where horizontally is accessing another account of the same permission group (i.e. another user), whereas vertically is that of another permission group (i.e. an administrator).
		5. Post-Exploitation
			This stage involves a few sub-stages:  
				**1.** What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting)
				**2.** What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are a privileged user
				**3.**  Covering your tracks
				**4.** Reporting

OSSTMM
	Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual provides a detailed framework of testing strategies for systems, software, applications, communications, and the human aspect of cyber security.
	Methodology Covers:
		1. Telecommunications
		2. Wired Networks
		3. Wireless Communications
		Advantages:
			Covers various testing strategies in-depth
			Includes testing strategies for specific targets
			Flexible depending upon the org's needs
			The framework is meant to set a standard for systems and applications, meaning that a universal methodology can be used in a penetration testing scenario.
		Disadvantages:
			The framework is difficult to understand, very detailed, and tends to use unique definitions.
OWASP
	Open Web Application Security Project is a community driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services.
